Given a point A within the angle and a point B and C on each edge of a angle,
Find a straight line passing through point A, with the two sides of the intercept at points D and E, so that DB=CE (points D and B are on the same ray, and CE is the same)

已知角内一点A及边上各一点B和C，
求作过点A的直线，截角的两边分别于点D和E，使得DB=CE（点D和B在同一条射线上，CE也如此）
