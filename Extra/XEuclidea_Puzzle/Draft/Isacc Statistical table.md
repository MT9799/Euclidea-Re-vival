|   1 | Square on 2 Circle          | Given two circles, find a square so that the vertices are pairwise on the circle.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   2 | Trilinear on Equal 2 Circle | Given two equally large circles and a point on the line connecting their centers, find a trilinear so that the starting and ending points are on the same circle, the other two vertices are on another circle, and the intersection is a given point. |
|   3 | Trilinear in Circle         | Given a circle and its two points above it, find a trilinear, such that the starting and ending points are given points, and the remaining vertices are on the circle.                                                                                 |
